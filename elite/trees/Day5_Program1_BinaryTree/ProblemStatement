Given the in-order and post-order traversals of a binary tree, construct 
the original binary tree. For the given Q number of queries, 
each query consists of a lower level and an upper level. 
The output should list the nodes in the order they appear in a level-wise.

Input Format:
-------------
An integer N representing the number nodes.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the similar to in-order traversal.
A space-separated list of N integers representing the similar to post-order traversal.
An integer Q representing the number of queries.
Q pairs of integers, each representing a query in the form:
Lower level (L)
Upper level (U)

Output Format:
For each query, print the nodes in order within the given depth range

Example
Input:
7
4 2 5 1 6 3 7
4 5 2 6 7 3 1
2
1 2
2 3
Output:
[1, 2, 3]
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
